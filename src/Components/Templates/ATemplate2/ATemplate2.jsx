          <h1>Hi, my name is Andrew.</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a software engineer, classically trained in mechanical
            engineering, currently on the pursuit for experience and growth in
            the industry of software programming.

          <h1>Work Experience</h1>
          <p>
            In 2018, I took a position as a Mechanical Engineer at Pearl Harbor
            Naval Shipyard & IMF for 15 months. Very broadly, I was responsible
            for acquiring, maintaining, and repairing valve components. To
            fulfill my responsibilities, I had to work in harmony with a team of
            12+ mechanics while providing instructions to meet engineering
            requirements. I was also involved with a technological sprint by
            spearheading a group of 10-15 engineers and authorities to establish
            new shipyard repair processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Pearl Harbor, I was a Senior Quality Control Technician at a
            local camera shop in Kaimuki called Hawaii Camera from 2015 until
            2018. I primarily had to manage daily quality control operations to
            meet company standards. Maintaining rental photo/video equipment
            required an attention to detail and a drive for integrity to give
            customers products that are trustworthy regardless of its prior use.
            I also provided technical support for customers over the phone and
            demonstrations for proper use when in the shop.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2013, I was a summer intern for County of Kauai's IT department
            during their Summer Employment Program. Providing technical
            assistance to county personnel through helpdesk and
            distributing/installing IT equipment across various county
            departments would be the typical day. The highlight however, was
            setting up the workstations for the county's new emergency backup
            dispatch station.

              design project that puts engineering student's culmination of
              skills to a final test. The project pushed my team to pitch and
              seek out sponsorships for funding from scratch and emphasize
              collaborative design and manufacturing for real world usage. Upon
              completion, we were responsible for presenting and competing at
              the 2018 ASME HPV Challenge.
